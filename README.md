This is a project from the course Programming in WEB 1. This is an online application made for organising and supervising training appointments in gyms.

## Description

There are 3 types of users:
1. Administrator
2. Coach
3. Gym memeber and ordinary users

Without registration, users can filter gym by some parameters such as: gym's name, adress, year of openning and also can see the time of training in every gym. After registration or log in, gym members can register for any treining in any gym. In addition, they can leave a review, leaving a comment and mark. They can see their previous trainings. 

Coaches can only work in one gym and make appointments in that gym. They can cancel training which have not been done yet. Additionally, they can see the list of users which have been registered for the training. Just as any ordinary user, coaches can filter trainings and see their previous treinings.

Administrator is a gym owner. Administrator's role is to add new coaches and supervise trainings. Also, coaches can be removed from the gym. Before the comments are shown, administrators must approve it before. Administrators have all functionalities, which include filtering and seeing trainings and their gym.
